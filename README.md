## Feature Engineering

### Time-Based Features

- **Time of Day**: Categorized into Morning, Afternoon, and Evening based on the transaction time.
- **Day Name**: Extracted the day of the week from the transaction date.
- **Month Name**: Extracted the month name from the transaction date.

Columns such as **Time of Day** and **Month Name** were leveraged in Questions 9 (Total revenue by month) and 11 (Peak sales time of day) to provide deeper insights into time-based sales trends.

    - Determines which customer type (Members or Normal) contributes most to sales revenue.

### Customer Analysis

15. **Which is the most common customer type?**
    - Determines whether Members or Normal customers are more frequent shoppers.
16. **What is the gender distribution of transactions?**
    - Examines demographic splits among customers.
17. **What is the spending behavior of Members vs Normal customers?**
    - Compares spending patterns across customer types.
18. **Which payment method is most popular for each customer type?**
    - Analyzes payment method preferences by customer type.
19. **What is the gender distribution for each product line?**
    - Explores gender preferences for product categories.
20. **What are the average ratings provided by customers for each product line?**
